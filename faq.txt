Q: Does Text to speech voices works

A: Yes TTS Voices Will Work Forever

Q: Will it work forever? Even after Flash is retired?

A: Yes It should, that's the goal. Perhaps in the future when we all run 6000-bit machines implanted into our brains it won't be compatible with that anymore, but I'm sure there'll always be a way to run it. There is also futureproofing for Flash's discontinuation, since Offline includes a Flash install and a version of ungoogled-chromium that supports Flash. By default, it starts from this, but you can change that in settings.bat. The included Chrome should not be used for browsing beyond using Flash content. You can also look into projects like [Lightspark](http://lightspark.github.io/) and [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) that are attempting to recreate Flash.
